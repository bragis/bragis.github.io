				<li>Early on in my Ph.D., I worked with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~bobd/cgi-bin/">Bob Dougherty</a> on simulating the random motion of water molecules in the brain and how their response to MRI measurements would depend on the distribution, width, and myelination of axons within the region of interest. This was done in CUDA and I learned a lot from the project, both about GPU programming and MRI physics. You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/rfdougherty/dSim">Bob's GitHub page</a>.</li>
				<li>During my Ph.D. in the BMR group at Stanford, I worked a lot on producing quantitative parameter maps from the Double-Echo in Steady-State (DESS) sequence. We had multiple ways of computing these maps, and one of them was by using Matlab scripts. A <a href="https://github.com/bragis/MatlabDESS">repository with this code</a> is stored on my GitHub page.</li>
				<li>The DESS processing code described above was also implemented in a Horos plugin. Horos is a medical image viewer, based on the OsiriX medical image viewer. You can find the code for this plugin on my <a href="https://github.com/bragis/DESSmapsHorosPlugin">GitHub page</a> as well, along with instructions for how to install and use it.</li>
